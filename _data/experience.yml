      custom OSD front end and various automated components in the process. In addition, I regularly develop tools to assist with 
      the automation of common tasks in our environment and distribute them to the team to improve our overall efficiency. I manage 
      and maintain our Citrix environment, creating new applications and VMs as needed and working to ensure a secure and seamless 
      user experience. My other responsibilities included serving as a point of escalation for various business critical applications 
      and for tier three support.
