    description:
      As a Senior Desktop Analyst at Crown Castle, it is my primary responsibility to manage and administer our implementations of SCCM and 
      Citrix in a nationwide environment of over 6000 devices. I am responsible for testing and deploying monthly security and quality updates, 
      Windows feature upgrades, OSD task sequences, and other applications as required by the business. I transitioned our OSD process to 
      SCCM to allow for centralized management of our PC build process and developed custom software to automate many previously manual 
      procedures. In addition, I regularly develop tools to assist with the automation of common tasks in our environment and distribute 
      them to the team to improve our overall efficiency. I served on the architecture and implementation team for our Citrix environment, 
      which I currently manage and maintain as part of the Citrix team. My other responsibilities include serving as a point of escalation 
      for various business critical applications and for tier three support.

      determining the information necessary for our problem management process.
